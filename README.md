# n-slit-fdtd
N slit simulator using a 2D FDTD simulation in TMz configuration with ABCs to terminate the grid and a TFSF boundary to add a sinusoidal source propagating in one direction. Uses PyQt5, matplotlib and numpy (working on Anaconda 4.7.12). FDTD solver based on "2D TMz TFSF Boundary Example" in "Understanding the Finite-Difference
Time-Domain Method", John B. Schneider, https://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~schneidj/ufdtd/ufdtd.pdf.
